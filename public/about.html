<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>   Hello, Welcome to my page. For me coding is something i feel i can take to the next level.
I'am actually an automotive engineer, ive been working in the shop for years, but 
i feel that my talents are being wasted. I want to be able to reach the sky,
have no limits, and i feel that i can do that with coding, and programming.
</p>

<p>I have a good friend who's like a brother to me to thank for this new path.
  He told me a long time ago that i should do this, and he also told me that i'm the smartest
  person he knows that i shouldnt have a problem with coding. He gave me the courage to do 
  something completely out of my field and start over. Thanks henry!

<p> While most people might be doing this because it seems like a lazy job or because
  it takes less effort then most jobs, for me its quite the opposite. Running an automotive shop
  with employees and putting in so much effort on my part but not seeing results due to lack of
  shared effort from the rest of the team is why i want to do this. In my opinion coding was made for 
  people to go all out without needing others to achieve things.
